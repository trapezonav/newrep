The gypsy woman told my mother
Before I was born
I got a boy child's coming
He's gonna be a son of a gun
He gonna make pretty womens
Jump and shout
Then the world wanna know
What this all about
'Cause you know I'm here
Everybody knows I'm here
Yeah, you know I'm a hoochie coochie man
Everybody knows I'm here
